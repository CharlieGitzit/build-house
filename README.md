# build-house

#FreeCodeCamp (beta) curriculum
    * Final project outcome
    * Things to note: haven't used many of these tools since the original curriculum

Overall, I must admit, it was fun giving this project a run through, despite not having the most spectacular house, it was fun testing previously acquired knowledge and challenging myself to what has been stored in my minds data banks, and discovering what has been lost during processing along the path. That's all for now, until next time!
